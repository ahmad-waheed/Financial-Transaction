Generating Synthetic Datasets for Account Transactions

Description:
This repository focuses on the generation of synthetic datasets for training and testing purposes, particularly tailored for account transaction data in various industries such as software, manufacturing, real estate, retail, and healthcare. The primary objective is to create datasets that closely resemble real-world transactions, enabling organizations in different sectors to conduct automated work efficiently.

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to provide a resource for organizations across diverse industries to develop and test their data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence models using realistic transaction data. By synthesizing datasets that mimic genuine transactions, companies can enhance their data analytics capabilities, refine algorithms, and optimize processes without relying solely on proprietary or sensitive data.

Contents:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) file is provided, offering insights into the structure, distribution, and characteristics of the synthetic datasets. Visualizations and statistical summaries aid in understanding the data's properties and potential patterns.

Code Implementation: The repository contains the code implementation used to generate the synthetic datasets and perform EDA. Python scripts and Jupyter Notebook files are included, demonstrating step-by-step procedures for dataset generation, data manipulation, and analysis.

Merging Datasets: Additionally, a file detailing the process of merging individual industry datasets into a single comprehensive CSV file is provided. This merged dataset facilitates cross-industry analysis and allows for broader insights into transactional patterns.
